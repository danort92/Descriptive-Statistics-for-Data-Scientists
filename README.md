## 1-Descriptive Statistics for Data Scientists

  Statistical study of a Real Estate dataset related to sales in Texas. The dataset contains the following variables: 
    -city: names of the cities involved in the analysis ;
    -year: years involved in the analysis;
    -month: months involved in the analysis;
    -sales: total n° of sales;
    -volume: totale value of sales [M$];
    -median_price: sales median price [$];
    -listings: total n° of listings;
    -months_inventory: time amount necessary to sell all the active listings at the actual rythm [months]
    
  The projects consists in the developments of the following points:
  
  
  *-Desciption of the different variable types of the dataset;*
  
  *-Analysis of indices of position (mean, median, quantiles, etc.), variability (dispersion index, coefficient of dispersion, relative variance, standard deviation,         Gini index, etc.) and distribution form (Fisher asymmetry index, Kurtosis index);*
  
  *-Definition of an "Effectiveness" variable to look at which city/which year has been the most effective in terms of sales;*
  
  *-Use of moments, dplyr, ggplot, gghalves packages to show significative diagrams, boxplots, line charts and plots.*
  
## 2-Inferential Statistics fornData Scientists

  Inferential study of a medical dataset regarding 2.500 newborns of 3 different hospitals, containing parameters related to mothers (age, smoker/non smoker, number of     previous pregnancies, etc.) and infants (sex, weight, length, skull diameter, etc.). The goal of the study is to provide a regression model for a newborn's weight       knowing mother's and other newborn's data. (e.g. does a mother who smokes have a higher probability to give birth to a underweight baby?)
